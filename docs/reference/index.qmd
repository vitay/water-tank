## Layers

Layers available for inputs, reservoirs, readouts, etc.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [RecurrentLayer](RecurrentLayer.qmd#water_tank.RecurrentLayer) | Reservoir of recurrently connected neurons. |
| [LinearReadout](LinearReadout.qmd#water_tank.LinearReadout) | Linear readout layer. Performs a weighted sum of its inputs, without dynamics. |
| [StaticInput](StaticInput.qmd#water_tank.StaticInput) | Static placeholder for input vectors. |
| [TimeSeriesInput](TimeSeriesInput.qmd#water_tank.TimeSeriesInput) | Dynamic placeholder for series of input vectors. |

## Projections

Connecting layers with each other.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [connect](connect.qmd#water_tank.connect) | Connects two layers with a (sparse) weight matrix and optionally a bias vector.  |
| [DenseProjection](DenseProjection.qmd#water_tank.DenseProjection) | Dense weight matrix. Created and returned by `connect()`. |
| [SparseProjection](SparseProjection.qmd#water_tank.SparseProjection) | Sparse weight matrix.  Created and returned by `connect()`. |

## Learning rules

Learning rules for online training of a projection.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [DeltaLearningRule](DeltaLearningRule.qmd#water_tank.DeltaLearningRule) |  |
| [RLS](RLS.qmd#water_tank.RLS) | Recursive least-squares (RLS) learning rule for FORCE learning. |

## Random distributions

Simple wrappers around numpy's random distributions.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [Const](Const.qmd#water_tank.Const) | Constant "random" distribution, returning the same value. |
| [Uniform](Uniform.qmd#water_tank.Uniform) | Uniform distribution, returning values between `min` and `max`. |
| [Normal](Normal.qmd#water_tank.Normal) | Normal distribution, returning values with a mean of `mean` and a standard deviation of `std`. |
| [Bernouilli](Bernouilli.qmd#water_tank.Bernouilli) | Bernouilli (binomial) distribution, returning the first of the two values with probability $p$. |
